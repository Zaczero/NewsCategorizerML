"I'm on my ninth life": Demi Lovato says she suffered three strokes and a heart attack during 2018 overdose

Demi Lovato is opening up about the grim and painful realities of suffering from addiction and mental health conditions. In a trailer for her new YouTube docu-series, released Wednesday, Lovato revealed that the overdose she experienced in 2018 caused her to have three strokes and a heart attack.

"I've had so much to say over the past two years wanting to set the record straight about what it was that happened," the actress and singer said at the beginning of the trailer.

The four-part documentary, "Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil," focuses on Lovato's personal and professional life leading up to and after the overdose she experienced in July 2018.

"I had three strokes. I had a heart attack," Lovato said. "My doctors said that I had five to 10 more minutes."

Many of Lovato's family, friends and other celebrities, including Elton John and Christina Aguilera, are seen in the trailer. Some of those featured said that they were unsure if she was going to survive the overdose. 

"I've had a lot of lives, like my cat. I'm on my ninth life," Lovato said. "I'm ready to get back to doing what I love, which is making music."

During a virtual panel for the Television Critics Association on Wednesday, Lovato also told reporters that she continues to suffer from brain damage from the incident that impacts her day-to-day abilities, according to The Associated Press.
